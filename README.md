# RectanglesPacking
Find the best solution and algorithms to pack rectangles in a square box.

### Tools
CMake ``3.12.3``.
CMake Standard: ``C++17``.

### MaxRectsBinPack
Developed by Jukka Jylänki's


### rectpack2D
Developed by Patryk Czachurski from hypersomnia team to deal with 2D images rectangles to be deployed 
in hypersomnia. 

The beauty of this code is that is only header implemented, using metadata programming and so taking better performance
 in using pre-processor compilation advantages.

This will be my next step, to add this C++ header library to the project and test it.
